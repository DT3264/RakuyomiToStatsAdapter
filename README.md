# RakuyomiToMangaAdapter

This plugin was born because 
- I enjoy seeing the weekly statistics on my kobo lockscreen when it is off.
- I read manga using [rakuyomi](https://hanatsumi.github.io/rakuyomi/)
- I wanted a way for mangas read through rakuyomi to contrbute to the statistics in an organized way (otherwise you get long unrelated names)

There might be a better way to do this, but after a couple of days of learning lua and smashing my head against the keyboard, this correctly reports the manga being read with pages (somewhat accurate), so it checks.
